\title{Perform Post-Demographic Diagnosis on Models}
\usage{
post_demo_diagnose(models, n_iter = 100)
}
\arguments{
\item{models}{A list of models. For the combined model setup, the list should contain
two models with names "vote" and "undecided". For the single model setup, the list
should contain one model.}

\item{n_iter}{The number of iterations to perform. Default is 100.}
}
\value{
A data frame with predictions for each iteration, including the predicted class,
predicted probability, and the real class.
}
\description{
This function performs a post-demographic diagnosis on a set of models by iteratively
training and testing them on subsets of the data. It supports both a combined model
setup (with "vote" and "undecided" models) and a single model setup.
}
\examples{
# Example usage:
models <- list(vote = vote_model, undecided = undecided_model)
result <- post_demo_diagnose(models, n_iter = 100)
